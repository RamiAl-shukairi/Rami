# The-Stats-Optic
The Stats Optic Project 

My interest in football backdates to the early Barclays Premier League days of Thierry Henry and Arsene Wenger. 
Hint: I support Arsenal. I have always been interested in the stat visuals that Sky or BT upload midgame to tell us the number 
of passes made, or the amount of possession a team has at the end of the half. Now, the influence of stats to winning games is 
really where i wanted to task myself with finding which data a manager or player will want to look at to make a difference in a 
game. This is where The Stats Optic came in, I continue , week in week out, to look at game data, watch matches to understand how 
team collective stats and individual player stats can be manipulated.
